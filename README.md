# SwearTrek

I made a Discord bot for my friends and I.  Calling up Swear Trek gifs is one part of it that I pulled out and made it's own repo.

I love Star Trek and Swear Trek, so I wanted to be able to call up a random Swear Trek gif on demand.

Type /st to pull the slash command in Discord after adding your own bot.
